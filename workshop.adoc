== Introduction

KSQL is the streaming SQL engine for Apache Kafka. This workshop will step through some practical examples of how to
use KSQL to build powerful stream-processing applications:

* Filtering streams of data
* Joining live streams of events with reference data (e.g. from a database)
* Continuous, stateful aggregations

== Pre-reqs / testing the setup
First things first, let's get connected to the lab environment and make sure we have access to everything we need.
In the following commands, be sure to replace `<username>` with *your own first initial plus last name*. 

=== Open up a terminal session to the gateway server
(for MacOS / Linux users)
[source,bash]
----
ssh <username>@ec2-52-14-94-160.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com
----
(for Windows users)
----
putty <username>@ec2-52-14-94-160.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com
----
You will be prompted for a password, which is `ksqlr0ck$`

=== Control Center
Test that you can open the Control Center web page by opening up a browser window and navigating to
`http://controlcenter-<username>.selabs.net:9021`. 

The login credentials for the Control Center are `admin/Developer1`

=== Syntax Reference
You will find it helpful to keep a copy of the KSQL syntax guide open in another browser tab: 
`https://docs.confluent.io/current/ksql/docs/developer-guide/syntax-reference.html`

== KSQL

KSQL can be accessed via either the command line interface (CLI), a graphical UI built into Confluent Control Center, or the documented https://docs.confluent.io/current/ksql/docs/api.html[REST API].

In this workshop we will be using the CLI. If you have used tools for MySQL, Postgres or Oracle's sql*plus before this should feel very familiar.
Let's switch back to our terminal session and fire it up!

[source,bash]
----
ksql
----
This will connect to your personal KSQL Server for the lab. You can open as any many of these, in separate terminal sessions, as you need.

Make sure that you get a successful splash screen and admire the ASCII-art :-)

[source,bash]

=== Looking around
Let's quickly get familiar with this environment by taking a look around:

[TIP]
====
You can navigate your KSQL command history much like a BASH shell:

  * type `history` to see a list of previous commands
  * `!123` will retrieve a previous command
  * `ctrl-r` invokes a 'backward search' for commands matching whatever you type next, use arrow keys to navigate matches
====

=== See available Kafka topics and data

KSQL can be used to view the topic metadata on a Kafka cluster - try `show topics;` and `show streams`:

* `show topics;`
* `show streams;`

We can also investigate some data:

* `print 'xxxx' limit 3` or 
* `print 'xxxx' from beginning limit 3;`

The topics we will use today are *`ratings`* and *`rds.<username>.CUSTOMERS-raw`*

The event stream driving this example is a simulated stream of events representing the ratings left by users
on a mobile app or website, with fields including the device type that they used, the star rating (a score from 1 to 5), 
and a an optional comment associated with the rating.

Notice that we don't need to know the format of the data when `print`ing a topic; KSQL introspects the data and understands how to deserialize it.

[TIP]
====
Because kafka topic names are case-sensitive ("Ratings" and "ratings" are two different topics on a Kafka broker) we 
take care to single-quote the topic names and correctly case them whenever we have to reference them. All the KSQL constructs 
though, like Streams and Tables and everything else, are case-insensitive as you would expect from a database-like system.
====

[source,sql]
----
ksql> PRINT 'ratings';
Format:AVRO
9/12/19 12:55:04 GMT, 5312, {"rating_id": 5312, "user_id": 4, "stars": 4, "route_id": 2440, "rating_time": 1519304104965, "channel": "web", "message": "Surprisingly good, maybe you are getting your mojo back at long last!"}
9/12/19 12:55:05 GMT, 5313, {"rating_id": 5313, "user_id": 3, "stars": 4, "route_id": 6975, "rating_time": 1519304105213, "channel": "web", "message": "why is it so difficult to keep the bathrooms clean ?"}

Press Ctrl-C to cancel and return to the KSQL prompt. 


==== Session properties
Investigate session properties with `show properties;`. Although we won't be adjusting these today, the session properties mechanism is how you can temporarily adjust various performance settings for any subsequent queries you issue.


== Getting started with DDL
To make use of our ratings and customers topics in KSQL we first need to define some Streams and/or Tables over them.

==== Create the Ratings data stream
Register the RATINGS data as a KSQL stream, sourced from the 'ratings' topic
[source,sql]
----
create stream ratings with (kafka_topic='ratings', value_format='avro');`
----
Notice that here we are using the Schema Registry with our Avro-formatted data to pull in the schema of this stream automatically.
If our data were in some other format, such as JSON or CSV messages, then we would also need to specify each column and it's datatype in the `create` statement.

Check your creation with `describe ratings;` and a couple of `select` queries. 

What happens ? Why ?

Try `describe extended ratings;`

=== Bring in Customer lookup data from MySQL

Defining a lookup table for Customer data from our MySQL CDC data-feed is a multi-step process:
[source,sql]
----
create stream customers_cdc with(kafka_topic='rds.<username>.CUSTOMERS-raw', value_format='AVRO');
----
Quickly query a couple of records to check it (remember you can `describe` the stream to see the column names!). 

Practice the art of "struct-dereferencing" with the "`->`" operator.
[source,sql]
----
select after->first_name as first_name, after->last_name as last_name from customers_cdc;
----
  
What happens when you query from this new stream ? Why is that the case ?

[TIP]
====
If we aren't pushing new records into this stream (technically into it's backing topic) by changing data in MySQL
then we won't see any query output. At this point you might want to skip ahead a couple of paragraphs to the 'Changing Data in MySQL' section so you can see 
some output from this `customers_cdc` stream query, and then come back here to continue.
====

[NOTE] (side discussion: when to use `set 'auto.offset.reset' = 'earliest';`)

==== Re-format the CDC data

We want to extract just the changed record values from the CDC structures, re-partition on the ID column, and set the target topic to have the same number of partitions as the source `ratings` topic:
[source,sql]
----
create stream customers_flat with (partitions=1) as select 
after->id as id, 
after->first_name as first_name, 
after->last_name as last_name, 
after->email as email, 
after->club_status as club_status, 
after->comments as comments 
from customers_cdc partition by id;
----
Register the CUSTOMER data as a KSQL table, sourced from this new, re-partitioned, topic
[source,sql]
----
create table customers with (kafka_topic='CUSTOMERS_FLAT', value_format='AVRO');
----
  
We can check our output with
[source,sql]
----
describe extended customers;
----
check the "total messages" value and see how it changes over time if you re-issue the same instruction after making some changes in MySQL.
  

==== Changing data in MySQL
In a new terminal window, side-by-side with the one you are using already, use `ssh` to connect to the server again (just like we did right at the beginning), and launch the MySQL client
[source,bash]
----
mysql
----
You should be able to see your source CUSTOMERS table here, and inspect it's records with `select * from CUSTOMERS` (note the table name is case-sensitive!)
Try inserting a new record or updating an existing one
Example: update name of a record to be your own name
[source,sql]
----
> update CUSTOMERS set first_name = 'Jay', last_name='Kreps' where id = 1;
----

[TIP]
====
If you leave your KSQL `select...from customers;` query running in the first window, watch what happens as you change data in the MySQL source.
====

=== Identify the unhappy customers

Now that we have both our ratings and our continuously-updating customer data, we can join them together 
 to find out details about the customers who are posting negative reviews, and see if any of them are our valued elite customers.
 
* Back in KSQL, we start by finding just the low-scoring ratings
[source,sql]
----
select * from ratings where stars < 3 and channel like 'iOS%' limit 5;
----
(play around with the `where` clause conditions to experiment)

* Now convert this test query into a persistent one (a persistent query is one which starts with `create` and continuously writes its' output into a topic in Kafka:
[source,sql]
----
create stream poor_ratings as select * from ratings where stars < 3 and channel like 'iOS%';
----

* Which of these low-score ratings was posted by an elite customer ? To answer this we need to join our customers table:
[source,sql]
----
create stream vip_poor_ratings as 
select r.user_id, c.first_name, c.last_name, c.club_status, r.stars
from poor_ratings r
left join customers c
on r.user_id = c.rowkey
where lcase(c.club_status) = 'platinum';
----

* What do you think would happen if you went and changed the `club_status` of a customer while this join query is running ?


=== Monitoring our Queries

[INFO]
====
- so what's actually happening here ?
[source,sql]
----
show queries;
explain <query_id>;  (case sensitive!)
----
====

Over in the Control Center browser window, navigate to 'Consumers' and, in the table of consumer groups, try to find the one for our join query and click on it (TIP: all the names are prefixed with '_confluent_ksql_' plus the ID of the query, as shown in the output of `explain queries`).

What do we see ? 

It's also possible (although not setup in this lab environment) to monitor a series of JMX metrics for each running query.


  
== Extra Credit

Time permitting, let's explore the following ideas:

  * which customers are so upset that they post multiple bad ratings in quick succession ? Perhaps we want to route those complaints direct to our Customer Care team to do some outreach...

[source,sql]
----
select first_name, last_name, count(*) as rating_count
from vip_poor_ratings
window tumbling (size 5 minutes)
group by first_name, last_name
having count(*) > 1;
----
  
  * mask the actual user names in the ouput

  * explore and describe the available functions
  * create a new stream over a topic that doesn't exist yet
  * use `insert...values` to write a couple of test records into this new topic
  * join it to one of our existing streams or tables
